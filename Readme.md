# D2X Application

### An python GUI Application made for people who wants to keep the data in Excel synchronised and updated in SQL without writing any SQL queries.

#### There will be three options available to user, where user can choose any following from excel to SQL operations and vice versa:
<br>
A) On clicking “Sync to Excel file from Database”, it will import all the created or updated data from SQL to the Excel File.
<br>
B) On clicking “Create Database from Excel File”, it will create a blank database file “database.db” and export all the data from Excel file to SQL.
<br>
C) On clicking “Sync to Database from Excel File”, whatever changes that has been made in the excel file will reflect in the Database with a click.
